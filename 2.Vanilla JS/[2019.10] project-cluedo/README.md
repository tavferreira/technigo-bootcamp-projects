## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and for that building a webpage that would mimic Cluedo.
The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. There should also be a button to reveal the mystery.

These were some suggestions for stretch goals and a deep-dive in this project:

* Make the site responsive.
* Spend some time to make it look nice.
* Add images of your suspects and maybe the weapons.
* Add the functionality to say something like: "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet.
* Add a fourth deck of card, maybe about when the murder was commited.

## 2. What did I do?

For this project I started by building the objects and grouping them into arrays so they could be easily randomized. It was built a function to pick a random object when clicking a card, then it was the DOM would show the data for that specific object. 
It was also introduced some type of validation on the button if there was some card that wasn't flipped yet.
The website is responsive.
