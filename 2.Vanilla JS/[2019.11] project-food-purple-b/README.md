## 1. What is this?

This project was built during meet up and it was a team project. The team, composed by 7 elements, was split into 3 sub-groups and each sub-groups had a different task. In the end we had to merge our code together and deal with merging conflicts.

The purpose of this project was to build a food review site that would show Pizza restaurants in Dublin, Ireland.

This was done by targeting Tomato API and we had to style the website to look like Deliveroo.


## 2. What did I do?

The sub-group I was in was responsible to implement two features (sort by price and filter by review). 

For the first we user sort on the array that contained the restaurants and created an help function to return comparison based on two objects (restaurants).

For the second one, we've simply used filter to filter the restaurants that had that rating.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
