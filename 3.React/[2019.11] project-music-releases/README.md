## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to create a page using react that would mimic Spotify. 
This exercise was for learn how to write React components, to use .map to iterate over an array of data and mount many components, to use React props to feed information to components and how to structure React projects into small chunks.


## 2. What did I do?

For this project I created several components to help building the page. Album and Playlist have almost the same structure, but are slightly different as the structure of the playlist object was also different.

All the styling was built with vanilla CSS.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
