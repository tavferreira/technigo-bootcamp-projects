My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
Haven't had a lot of time to do the project, but after re-watching Wednesday and Friday sessions everything became clearer. 
The project didn't seem too complicated, but I've realized that I was understanding some React concepts while doing.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
Not sure. As mentioned I didn't have much time, so it felt that it was the best I could do. 
I guess I would have some more opinions if I would have dug deeper in the project.
One thing that I can mention is some configurations around React / Node.js that were preventing me to do a better job, 
like having to restart the server every time I made a change. I understand it would be difficult to have an explanation for every case,
and I guess I'm paying the price of being a minority (by using Linux).
