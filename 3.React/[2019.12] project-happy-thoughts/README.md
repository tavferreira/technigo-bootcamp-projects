## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to practice fetching and posting data to an API.
With this project I've learned:
* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within useEffect.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## 2. What did I do?

For this project I've created different components for the Happy Thought sender and another one to render the list of Happy Thoughts.
This was done with help of three different endpoints. One to get the thoughts, another to post/create thoughts and another one that would like a thought on the wall. 

There was no authentication needed to create thoughts, but it was needed to take into consideration the thought id to like it.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
