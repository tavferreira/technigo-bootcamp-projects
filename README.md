`PROJECT 2`

# Build a News Site

This week’s project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

Something like this:

The code folder contains a starter html file, a css file, and a Technigo logo to use if you want to.

Feel free to make a news site about whatever you like, it could be tech, sports, dinosaurs or avocados. The focus on this project is to practise what you've learned about responsive design and the layout technique flexbox.
