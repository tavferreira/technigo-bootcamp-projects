## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to learn how to structure and layout webpages using boxmodel and flexbox, but also to create a responsive webpage for mobile, desktop and tablet.
These were the requirements for the project:
* The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar.
* This should change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop.
* The site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news.
* On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## 2. What did I do?

For this project my plan was to build the entire structure on html first and only then I've styled it. 
I've used flexbox as asked for this assignment to layout the webpage and CSS media queries to control the webpage structure on different devices.
That become hard to control after a while, so in the future I would start by building blocks and style them after they are done.
