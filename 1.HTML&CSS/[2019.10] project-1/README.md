This project was built using mob-programming techiques by a team composed by [Eva-Lisa Saksi](https://github.com/microlinamedia), [Joacim Nilsen](https://github.com/JoacimNilsen), [Ivett](https://github.com/Lilivet) and me.

## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to mimic a BuzzFeed page for a random subject. Our theme for the project was `6 Things anyone with a bathroom canÂ´t live without`.

## 2. What did we do?

We've started by drawing some sketches on how the webpage should look like, which took more time than we wanted (this task was built on a meet-up and we have limited time).
Then we started by building the structure in HTML, but that lead us to some problems as what we were building was not entirely visible (and we had not much experience in it).
The HTML was divided in a header, introduction and then the article section. 
The styling is pretty simple as we didn't have time for much more.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
