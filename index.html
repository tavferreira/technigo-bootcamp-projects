			<p>A browser or web browser is a piece of software that presents the web resource you choose. It does that by making a request to the server where that resource is located and displaying it in the browser windows you have opened on your computer, tablet or mobile phone. Usually that resource is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document, but it can be many different things, such as a PDF, an image or some other type of content. It was decided to call the location of these resources URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).</p>

	  		<p>The web browser interprets these HTML files over HTML and CSS specifications which are maintained by an organization that standardizes the web (W3C - World Wide Web Consortium). For many years browsers would only conform to some specification, enabling others by their own extensions. That caused serious compatibility issues and today most browsers conform to these specifications.</p>
